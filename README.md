### Git Best Practices

- **Commit often**: Don't wait until all assignments are done
- **Write clear commit messages**: Describe what you changed and why
- **One assignment per commit**: Makes it easier to track progress
- **Don't commit sensitive data**: No private keys or personal information
- **Keep your fork updated**: Pull any updates from the original repository if needed

### Important Notes

- ✅ Fork the starter repository before beginning work
- ✅ Maintain the exact folder structure provided
- ✅ Commit your work regularly with clear messages
- ✅ You can develop in the playground, but code must be in the repository
- ✅ Documentation must explain your design choices, not just describe functions
- ✅ Update the main README.md with your progress
- ✅ Submit your repository URL when ready for grading
- ❌ Do not modify the folder names
- ❌ Do not delete or rename provided files
- ❌ Do not commit compiled files or deployment artifacts
- ❌ Do not wait until the last minute to commit everything

### Final Submission

When all assignments are complete:

1. **Verify** all files are committed and pushed to GitHub
2. **Double-check** that your repository is public (or accessible to instructor)
3. **Test** that your repository URL works in an incognito/private browser window
4. **Submit** your repository URL in the format:
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clarity-smart-contract-assignments
   ```
5. Submission link will be provider in the group chat.
